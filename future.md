# Upcoming changes

## Done in current dev

* play online feature - play through public webserver
* Mage and Witch (Mini #5) expansion
* tile rotation behavior changed - tile is rotated to first valid position
* added play again button
* show tunnel tokens supply in control panel
* CornCicles ui - don't ask if there is not deployed any follower of that kind (if no player can perform any action)
* click on tile in control panel triggers rotation
* take board screenshot (pull request by Decar)
* improved image quality (Tunnel, Corn Circles, Festival)
* server can be run without ui - just run SimpleServer.main()
* fix: if game folder is not writeable, system APPDATA dir (win) or ~/.jcloisterzone (unix) is used
* fix: Cathars escape is not allowed for builder
* fix: beep sound playback in Linux

## Roadmap

*  custom configuration - eg tiles from Abbey&Mayor + wagon but  no Abbey and no Mayor.
* Hills ans Sheeps
* .. and more expansions :)
